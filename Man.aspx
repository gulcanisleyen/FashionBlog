					<h1>How to Dress for a Beach Wedding</h1>
                    <p>More weddings happen during the summer than any other season, so it’s likely you’ll eventually be invited to one at the beach. And given the high temperatures and easy vibe, you don’t want to show up in the same suit you wear to the office. “No bells and whistles. Just go iconic, classic, and simple,” says celebrity stylist Ilaria Urbinati, whose line for Eddie Bauer is set to launch in October. We asked her to give us the rundown on what to wear for a beach wedding, and how to make sure you’re the second best dressed man of the evening.</p>

					<h1>The Best Swimsuits for Men By Body Type</h1>
					<p> A good day at the beach doesn’t require much more than a pair of swim shorts, some sunshine and sand, a breeze, a high SPF, and maybe a boat. That mix might seem simple, but it’s easy to mess up with the one thing you have full control over: the fit of your swimsuit. Ill-fitting, unflattering trunks can squander all hope you have of looking back on this summer’s photos fondly, or remembering anything about waterskiing other than a perpetual wedgie. And don’t even think about a summer of love. For that reason, your swimwear is an investment.  </p>

					<h1>40 Watches Your Grandkids Will Fight Over</h1>
					<p>Smart-watches are useful tools — that’s the whole point — but it’s hard to imagine anyone handing down his Apple Watch to his son, much less his son handing it down to his child. For that, you need a classic timepiece. These 40 models are to watches what the 911 is to sports cars. This is less an impulse buy than an investment: The least expensive timepiece on our list, the Swatch Watch, will set you back $60; the priciest goes for $78,500. But that watch “will look as good on your wrist today as it will in 10, 20, or 30 years,” says Leonardo Solis, a Boston-based watch collector.

					<h1>9 Stylish Summer Polos</h1>
					<p> A good T-shirt is the official uniform to fight the sweltering heat, but every guy needs that one great polo — a do-everything shirt that’s just as at home on the sandy beach or wearing in the office before you leave for the beach. These are the polos to take with you everywhere this summer. But we wouldn’t blame you for buying them a little early. No roundup is complete without the all-American classic Polo. Between the iconic horse branding, wide array of colors, and assorted fabric makeups, the choice of brand is easy, but finding the perfect fit and style can be trickier.  </p>

					<h1>Best Leather Gloves for Winter</h1>
					<p> Instead of treating gloves as a wardrobe afterthought, buy a quality pair. They’ll not only keep you warm, but they’ll look good with the rest of your clothes, too. And make sure they fit you. “Winter gloves should fit snugly but not tightly – they need to have room for air, which insulates,” says Bryan Freedman, owner of the San Francisco–based retailer Leather Gloves Online. “To find your size, wrap a tape measure around the middle of your palm. That number is your glove size. Then round up to the nearest whole size for winter gloves.” Here are four top-end leather and suede pairs we like.
